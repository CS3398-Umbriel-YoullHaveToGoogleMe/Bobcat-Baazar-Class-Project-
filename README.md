# Bobcat-Baazar-Class-Project-

Our files are not yet connected for sprint 1.

The Front-End files are located in the HTML folder and need to be within the same directory to function.

The Database Files are located in the Bobcat_Bazaar/flaskr folder. For this sprint the database is not connected with the application. But for the next sprint we will have the Database connected with our application.

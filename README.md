# Bobcat-Baazar-Class-Project-

Our files are not yet connected for sprint 1.

The Front-End files are located in the HTML folder and need to be within the same directory to function.

The Database Files are located in the Bobcat_Bazaar/flaskr folder. For this sprint the database is not connected with the application. But for the next sprint we will have the Database connected with our application.

Next Steps:

Aadil Khatri: Research to find another database that will best fit with our application, and we might switch to another database depending on how it fits with our application and other team members.Make a login page where it will take the Username, password and email address and automatically will store it into the database. Add list of books name, description and its price as soon as the user adds a post.

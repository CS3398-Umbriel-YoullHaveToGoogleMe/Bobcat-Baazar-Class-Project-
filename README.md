HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION:
Also have to have python 3.6 installed to run this.
Before running the application make sure to have Flask,Flask_pymongo, and Bycrypt installed.

How to run Bobcat Bazaar Class Project.
	To run the project build and compile the __init__.py file. This should start running a web services on 127.0.0.1:5000
	From here you will be presented with our home page. To use the site you will need to register with a username and password of your choosing. To post book into the site go to the sell tab and fill out all the informatino for the book. To buy a book, go to buy tab and fill out the information for the book you are looking for.

Sprint 3:

  Nabil Manasiya :
- I created the table on the sell page that works as a results table from the user search for a book. 
  The idea behind the results table was to present users with a simple yet organized way to see their output of books. 
  There was a part were my team mate steven hernandez helped me in organizing the data within the tables.
- I also worked on adding logic to the drop down menus on buy and sell page. In our previous sprint we had our drop downs
  present us with fields that were same for all of the colleges and departments, but this time i made the department drop
  down depend on the college drop down making it change according to the userâ€™s selection of college.
- My code/artifact file that this readme is refering to could be found on the master brance, it is a text file which is named
  Reference_code_for_README_NABIL_MANASIYA.txt. This file contains code that is used in our sell.html page and buy.html page.
  This code is one of the many key features that we have in our project.

	
Back End Next Sprint:
(Steven Hernandez and Salvador Romero)
Main Goal: Combine front and back end.
and continue development.

We will need to learn more of the flask
web framework and get more familiar with it.
Learning how to replace the stock html pages 
that the Flask tutorial provided with our own 
html pages.

Front End Sprint 3 retropsective:
(Nabil Manasiya and Matt Stephens)
Nabil: Created the menu on the buy and sell pages. Deigned and implemented the login pages. (In the buy.html, sell.html, login1.html)
Matthew: Created site design and navigation. (added to all html files except the login1 file)
	For this sprint I checked in with my team on slack and met with nabil and the rest of the team after class mmore often than last 	sprint. I still should've been more actively communicating with my team.

Back End Final Sprint:
(Steven Hernandez and Salvador Romero)
Main Goal: Finish routing all of the pages together. 
Set up sessions so that we can keep track of users information during 
the time they have logged in.

Database Final Sprint:
(Moiz Ahmed & Aadil Khatri)
Main Goal: the Database team will assess and understand any and all additional requirements/features and develop the database with all the required data structures. Also, we need to design a more robust database schema after consulting with back-end. After all that, we need to make it connect to back-end smoothly with out any problems.

Implementing SOLID principles:
(discussion between team members)

Backend:
There is a way to devide the file containing the implementation of the backend into seperate files. We decided to keep everything in a single file since there is not much code needed to connect the backend with the front end. Once we add more to the file then we will need to revisit the question on how to devide the file. 

Front end:
For the front end we devided each page in our website into a different file.


Revisted SOLID part of the program:
	To seperate our programs we went with one single back end page. We did this since all the functionality of the page is uniform throughout the code. Whenever we defien a button in an html page, we coded that button to ridirect to the appropriate page afterwards. We decided to seperate each of the html pages into their own files. When a link(button) is clicked in any of the web pages the back end page will load the new page up and this process will conitnue until the user decides to close the webpage.
